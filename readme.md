# Web3 and Blockchain Learning Repository

Welcome to my Web3 and Blockchain learning journey! This repository contains resources, notes, and projects related to blockchain technology and Web3 development.

## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a special type of database that stores information in blocks that are linked together in a chain. Unlike regular databases controlled by one organization, blockchain is:

- **Decentralized**: No single person or company controls it
- **Transparent**: Everyone can see all transactions
- **Immutable**: Once information is added, it can't be changed
- **Secure**: Uses cryptography to protect data

## What is Web3?

Web3 is the next generation of the internet built on blockchain technology:

- **Web1**: Read-only websites (1990s-early 2000s)
- **Web2**: Interactive social platforms where companies own your data (current)
- **Web3**: User-owned internet where you control your data and digital assets


## Learning Path

This repository will grow as I continue learning about:

- Cryptocurrencies and tokens
- Smart contracts
- Decentralized applications (dApps)
- Decentralized finance (DeFi)
- Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- And more!

Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
