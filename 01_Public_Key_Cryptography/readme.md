# Public Key Cryptography

This folder contains notes and resources about Public Key Cryptography, which is a fundamental technology behind blockchain and cryptocurrencies.

## What is Public Key Cryptography?

Public Key Cryptography (also called asymmetric cryptography) is a system that uses pairs of keys:

- **Public Key**: Shared with everyone, used to encrypt messages or verify signatures
- **Private Key**: Kept secret, used to decrypt messages or create signatures

## Why is it Important for Blockchain?

Public Key Cryptography is essential for blockchain technology because it:

1. **Secures Wallets**: Your crypto wallet address is derived from your public key, while your private key gives you access to your funds

2. **Enables Digital Signatures**: When you make a transaction, you sign it with your private key, and others can verify it's really from you using your public key

3. **Ensures Security**: Even though blockchain is public and transparent, your funds remain secure as long as you protect your private key

## Contents of the PDF

The PDF "01_Public key Cryptography Notes.pdf" in this folder covers:

- Basic principles of encryption and decryption
- How public and private keys work together
- Digital signatures and verification processes
- Applications in blockchain technology
- Security considerations and best practices

## Key Takeaways

- Never share your private key with anyone
- Your public key can be safely shared with others
- If you lose your private key, you lose access to your assets forever
- The mathematical relationship between public and private keys makes blockchain secure while remaining transparent
